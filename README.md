Once these are installed, clone this repository to your file system, then run the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd uv-hello-world
npm install
npm start
```

If npm install causes errors on a Windows platform, you might need to install Cygwin (cf. https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/615/learn-how-to-solve-the-npm-error-cp-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or-batch-file).

Then browse to `localhost:5000`. (You can run the UV on regular port 80, we're just using 5000 to test on localhost).
